                 <h2 class="mt-5"> Literature Wonderland </h3>
                 <p class ="mt-4">There is something special and intimate about a hidden treasure and its quaint nature. It is unique and constantly being discovered. Full of the curious folk, the tourists, and the bibliophiles, McNally Jackson is a haven to all. It is like a breath of fresh air among the other hustle and bustle surrounding the bookstore in the chaotic frenzy of South Street Seaport. When you first hit the cobblestone and your shoes contour to the little dips in the pavement, you are transported to the days of old where you can faintly hear the clicks of the horse and carriages, leading you to this bookstore along the rickety road. You can almost imagine the coachmen helping you into the double glass doors with the brass handles, calling you to enter. Upon entering the midnight blue rims, your craving for adventure is immediately ignited.</p>
                 <p>The two floors are embellished with books: muted colors, distinctive lengths, and varied languages, all heavily laced with the aroma of fresh coffee from the in-store cafe. Accompanying the featured-book wooden tables are the tufted red leather couches and brown suede wide-base chairs, making you feel like you are in a vintage home-office. The exposed brick continues to lead you to the intricately adorned staircase, which creaks with every step from having to carry the weight of our pent up curiosity over its many years in service. When I clasp onto the worn wooden banister, I wonder what other hands have held this railing, and what worlds they have discovered by ascending up these stairs. </p>
                 <p>Each time I climb those steps, I become a stranger in a foreign land, a tourist among my native New York. I get lost in the literature-rich labyrinth, with every turn revealing miles of books. I could come here everyday of my life and still be a clueless wanderer, always discovering new nooks and crannies filled with mystery novels or the latest escapism romances. I remember how much pride I took in taking my friend to share this hidden gem, after her uncommon request of visiting a bookstore. She's not much of a reader, in fact, we have had numerous conversations where I've begged her to pick up a book and that yes, reading was something people like me do for fun, and no, I was not a psychopath for doing so. That day, I saw her eagerness as she strolled across the dusty floorboards. I saw her eyes subconsciously widen every time we turned the corner, as weaved through another vaulted arch of the book-studded cavern. As she browsed the store, she took to shelves I didn't even know existed. Books that were in Japanese, German, French, and so many other languages that neither of us would be able to decipher, but had an inclination to read anyway. Despite our nature of being chatty together, we were uncharacteristically silent. The sound of two people enjoying the doors around them being opened through an overwhelming amount of literature. Soon enough, she settled on a book that I had never heard of, from a genre I had never explored. Had I been on my own typical perusals, I would have never noticed it but thankfully, McNally Jackson is home to all kinds of niche finds.</p>
                 <p>Along with the different books that hug the shelves, there are constantly new books being displayed. The newest books from the New York Times Bestseller list, or the newest trending books from Tik Tok. There are so many different books that at this point, in an accumulation of all the times I've visited, I think I have witnessed every kind of person in the store and that's because books appeal to everyone. I will never get tired of the loud little children that fall silent as they grab the graphically illustrated books, catering to their newest obsessions or the devout self-help seekers creating new productivity habits. There is a book for everyone in every season of their life. All of us patrons who have been to McNally Jackson feel and have this shared desire of something greater whether this be accomplishment, entertainment, self-improvement, and the list goes on and on. Whatever our reason is, we are determined in seeking out something big.</p>
                 <p>Despite coming from different backgrounds and walks of life, everyone who sets foot in this independent bookstore is immediately unified with everyone else out of our common passion.  Sure, life will have us evolve at different paces, but our insatiable affection for reading will allow us to start a new chapter of our lives together, quite literally, and this begins when you enter this two-story, quaint bookstore nestled in the heart of South Street Seaport.</p>
